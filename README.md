# Mostly Sunny
A weather app
by **Jake Pfaffenroth** for **The Odin Project**

Created using:
* Vue.js
* Vuex
* VueGeolocation
* Tailwindcss
* date-fns

View live site at [weather.jakepfaffenroth.com](https://weather.jakepfaffenroth.com)

On iOS devices, add the site to your home page to access it like a native app.

**NOTE:** Due to free-tier API rate limits, the site will enter Dev Mode if necessary and load static weather data. The app remains functional while in dev mode, but weather data doesnâ€™t change.
