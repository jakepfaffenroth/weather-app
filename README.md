# Mostly Sunny
A weather app
by **Jake Pfaffenroth**

Frontend:
* Vue.js
* Vuex
* Chart.js
* Tailwindcss

Backend:
* Express
* Node

APIs:
* Geolocation data from HERE
* Weather data from Climacell

View live site at [weather.jakepfaf.dev](https://weather.jakepfaf.dev)

On iOS devices, add the site to your home page to access it like a native app.

**NOTE:** Due to free-tier API rate limits, the site will enter Dev Mode if necessary and load static weather data. The app remains functional while in dev mode, but weather data doesnâ€™t change.
